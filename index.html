                <p><!-- open paragraph -->
                   Olive started off as a project via my school, CareerFoundry. Olive is intended to allow health conscious users to track both their physical and mental health, learn more about health topics using various resources, and encourage and engage users to maintain (or create) healthy habits.
                 </p><!-- end paragraph -->
                 <p><!-- open paragraph -->
                     It was imperative to conduct and utilize both user testing and research in order to successfully create Olive. The feedback recieved from these testing methods played a massive part in where it is today. Olive was tailored to user liking in a manner that is physically accessible, mentally comprehensible, and aesthetically pleasing

                <h3>MiLexis</h3><!-- heading for the project -->
                <p><!-- open paragraph -->
                  MiLexis is a language-learning app. It is intended to assist users in strengthening their vocabulary in an engaging and educational way. MiLexis is accessible in multiple languages and caters to users of all ages!
                </p><!-- end paragraph -->
                <p><!-- open paragraph -->

                  MiLexis was my first interactive design. One of my most significant accomplishments and simultaneously my biggest struggle was making the application accessible. I was unsure how to balance a language or vocabulary application without specifying a specific age group. However, I was able to adapt to design rules and successfully create an application that is physically accessible, engaging, and mentally comprehensible.
