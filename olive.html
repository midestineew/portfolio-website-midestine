    <h2>What is Olive?</h2>
         <p display="float-img"> Olive is an application intended to allow health-conscious users to track their physical and mental health, overall well-being, and medical information. Provides resources such as articles, videos, and audio, that assist and teach users about their desired topics. Some of the most anticipated topics include blood pressure, weight, steps, etc.</p>
    <h2>My Role As A Designer</h2>
            <p>My main goal was to make Olive one of the most accessible applications users have interacted with This includes adding accessibility features for those who are vision and hearing impaired. Some of these features include subtitles, tap-to-speak, the ability to change font size, etc. It was also very important for me to use a comprehensible language, as you do not need a degree to use or understand the language used within Olive. Finally I wanted to make the interface aesthetically pleasing and calming. I felt as though this would allow users to further and consistently with Olive.  </p>
<h2>Olive Design Language</h2>

            <p>Olive is intended to provide users with a safe, healthy, and calming feel. This is emulated by “Olive Green” being the main color present in the high-fidelity design.
            The use of plain language to be understood by a wider audience.
             The IA used such as icons and language is commonly found on mainstream applications and platforms.</p>

    <h2>Olive Sitemap</h2>
       <p>The site map displays the flow of both features and potential functions of the Olive app. The different colors (blue and turquoise) and (green and yellow) indicate similar features within different original categories. This laid the blueprint for the respective locations of Olive's features and resources.</p>

<h2>The Process Low-Fi</h2>
        <p>Creating a general idea of how Olive would function allowed me to navigate throw key features and apply them to my designs. As seen in the updated Low-fidelity wireframe (pictured below), it is more details and explains the purpose of the icons located within the bottom horizontal tab bar. </p>

    <h2>The Process Mid-Fi</h2>
    <p>It was imperative to create all Mid and high fidelity on iPhone14 Plus to display a larger and more realistic screen size. These wireframes showcase the process of some of Olive's top features such as onboarding, tracking health, favoriting health, and searching.</p>

<h2> Olive Hypothesis</h2>
<p>If both an accessible and user-flexible offline application is provided then we will achieve a 7% increase in user activity via sign up's, (guest) log-ins, and feature usage.
    This idea is centered on usage. Specifically onboarding as this and the potential features makes or breaks a user's desire to continue using an application or site.
    This can be validated by keeping track of how often specific buttons are clicked.
    For example, noting when the "subtitles" button is clicked</p>

<h2>User Flow Chart</h2>
<p> The creation of the user flow chart using the personas “Santiago” and “Mia” created a visual of the intended design process. It displayed multiple pathways to complete different tasks and engage in multiple different features.

    This project allowed for multiple revisions, ultimately making the application what it is now. These pathways were influenced by personal experience and participant feedback from both user surveys and interviews.</p>

<h2>Tests Conducted</h2>
<p>Many methods of usability testing were conducted. These methods include
    User surveys 
    User Interviews
    A/B Preference Testing
    Closed Card Sorting
    Usability Testing using interactive prototype</p>

            <h2>The Process High-Fi</h2>
            <p>The creation of Olive as a high-fidelity interactive prototype consisted of listening to and acknowledging feedback received from the various usability tests that were conducted. These revisions made the app more "real". Whereas the application did not look "real" or usable in its mid-fidelity stage. It now includes more well-known icons, language, and accessibility features. Despite Olive being high-fidelity many revisions are to come in regards to the aesthetic or look. I would like to include more images and less animated icons.</p>

<h2>Self Reflection</h2>
<p> My role as a designer working on Olive has been both informative and fulfilling. Olive started as a school project but has become so much more. I started with a vision and am bringing it to life day by day. To see the progress is incredible. From tailoring the experience and interactions with future users to creating an aesthetically pleasing color scheme. I have a better idea of user wants, desires, and expectations.
    This project has taught me a lot, and as a designer, I am still learning and improving!</p>
